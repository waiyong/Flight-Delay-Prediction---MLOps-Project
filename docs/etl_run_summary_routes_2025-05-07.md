# ETL Run Summary: Routes Data (run_etl_routes.py)

**Date of Execution:** 2025-05-07
**Approximate Start Time:** 10:44 (based on first log entry)
**Approximate End Time:** 11:43 (based on last log entry)

## 1. Overview

This document summarizes the execution of the `run_etl_routes.py` script, which fetches route data from the AviationStack API and loads it into the PostgreSQL `routes` table.

## 2. Execution Metrics (Based on Logs)

-   **Total Records Fetched from API:** 208,033
    -   Logged as: `Completed fetching 208033/208033 routes records`
    -   Logged as: `Fetched 208033 total route records.`

-   **Records Processed and Attempted for Database Save:** 207,911
    -   Logged as: `Processed 207911 route records ...`

-   **Records Skipped (Not Saved to DB):** 122
    -   Reason: Missing one or more essential key fields (`flight_number`, `departure_iata`, `arrival_iata`).
    -   Logged as: `... (skipped 122 due to missing key fields).`
    -   Individual `WARNING` logs like `Missing required fields (flight_number, dep_iata, arr_iata) for route: ...` were generated for these.

-   **Records with Missing `airline_iata` (Still Processed & Saved with NULL `airline_iata`):** 3,264
    -   Logged as: `Found 3264 routes with missing airline IATA codes.`
    -   These records are included within the 207,911 processed records.
    -   Individual `INFO` logs like `Route with missing airline IATA code: ...` were generated for these.

## 3. Script Outcome

-   **Overall Status:** ✅ Successful Completion
    -   Logged as: `✅ ETL process for Routes completed.`
    -   The script ran to completion without fatal errors.

## 4. Conclusion

The `run_etl_routes.py` script executed successfully and behaved as expected based on the current code logic and data quality checks.

-   A total of **207,911 route records** were processed and should now reside in the `routes` table in the PostgreSQL database.
-   **122 records** were intentionally skipped due to missing core identifying information (`flight_number`, `departure_iata`, or `arrival_iata`), which is consistent with the script's data validation rules.
-   **3,264 records** were processed and saved with a `NULL` value for the `airline_iata` field. This outcome was anticipated, and these records can be identified and handled as needed during data analysis or model training phases.

No critical or unexpected database errors were reported in the logs for this run.
